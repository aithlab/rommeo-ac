# ROMMEO-AC

This repository is the implementation of the paper, [A Regularized Opponent Model with Maximum Entropy Objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08087).  
I transformed the TensorFlow code which is provided by the authors to PyTorch.  

For training and getting results:  
`python main.py`

Results:  
| Return | Policy |
|---|---|
